The COVID-19 pandeimc is disrupting our entire system of K-12 education, including assessment and accountabilty. I contributed to a new series of briefs from Bellwether that examine the past and present of school accountabilty to help inform their next interation:

> As a global pandemic interrupted purposefully designed systems of testing and accountability, we are left with critical questions: How does the underlying theory of standards-based accountability and its foundational goals of equity and transparency hold up decades later? What do key stakeholders need from these systems now? Given what weâ€™ve learned from decades of successes and failures, how should these systems continue to evolve in the face of mounting political opposition?

The series includes three briefs:

- The Historical Roots and Theory of Change of Modern School Accountability
- The Impact of Standards-Based Accountability
- Assessment and Accountability in the Wake of COVID-19
