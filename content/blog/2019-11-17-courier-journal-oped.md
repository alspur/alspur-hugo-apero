My first op-ed placed in Lousiville's paper of record, the Courier Journal: 

> All families deserve to choose the best educational path for their children, but right now in Louisville, that right is reserved only for the wealthy.
> Families with financial means who are unhappy with Jefferson County Public Schools have several options. They can move to nearby Oldham, Shelby or Bullitt counties, as thousands have done since the early 1990s, taking a significant amount of taxable wealth with them. Or they can enroll their children in one of the areaâ€™s many private schools, as thousands per year also do. Low-income families, meanwhile, are essentially asked to wait and hope that the school system improves.
