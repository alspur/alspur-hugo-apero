There's been a lot of talk about what is and isn't "infrastructre." I'm not sure that curriculum is infrastructure, but we ought to act like it is:

> Curriculum should serve as a foundational organizing force in student learning, informing instruction, assessment and professional development. Well-structured, strong curricula provide educators with instructional materials and resources to cover a clear scope and sequence of the knowledge and skills students are expected to master. But in far too many cases, schools don’t support educators and students with a well-structured curriculum — or any, for that matter.
