  I'm currently an associate partner with [Bellwether Education Partners](https://bellwethereducation.org) and a [50CAN National Voices Fellow](https://50can.org/programs/fellowships/2021cohort/). Prior to joining Bellwether in March 2019, I worked as a senior data scientist at the [Kentucky Center for Statistics (KYSTATS)](https://kystats.ky.gov) and served as a [Harvard Strategic Data Project Fellow](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/home)) at the Kentucky Department of Education.
  
  I got my start in education as a fifth-grade teacher and Teach For America corps member. That experience propelled me into education policy research and analysis through roles at [ConnCAN](https://www.conncan.org) and [TNTP](https://www.tntp.org) before moving to Kentucky in 2015.

  I'm a proud graduate of [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu) and [Bethel University](https://www.bethel.edu). When I'm not working on education issues, I read voraciously, coach lacrosse, and very much enjoy bourbon. 
  
  I strive to [be curious, not judgmental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S16b-x5mRA).
